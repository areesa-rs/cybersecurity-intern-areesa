## Brief Note

My approach to this task was influenced by my experience designing *ThreatLens*, an AI-powered Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) SaaS platform. When analysing risks, I focused heavily on tenant isolation, API security, and access control boundaries, as these are critical trust foundations in any multi-tenant SaaS system. Rather than listing generic vulnerabilities, I prioritised realistic, high-impact scenarios that reflect how attackers actually operate in production environments, balancing technical depth with practical mitigation strategies.
